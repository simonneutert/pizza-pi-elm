# elm based pizza pi calculator (with bulma css)

you need to have node 14 or 16 with elm on your machine

## start developing

`$ npm i` to load all dependencies

`$ npx elm-live src/Main.elm --start-page=custom.html --hot -- --output=main.js`

- visit http://localhost:8000

elm goodness!

(`$ elm reactor` might work for you if you don't need the css for developing)

### well ...

this project may not be exactly what an experienced elm sorcerer might hand out, but I just wanted to get hang of the language a little.
